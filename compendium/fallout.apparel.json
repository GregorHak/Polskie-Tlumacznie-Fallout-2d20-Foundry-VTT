Źródłem energii jest zamontowany na plecach reaktor mikrofuzyjny TX-28, do którego można podłączyć zwykły rdzeń fuzyjny (strona 94). Szkieletu PW nie da się modyfikować</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Obsługa0:</strong>Wejście do środka pancerza lub wyjście z niego wymaga akcji głównej. Na zakończenie każdej sceny, podczas której PW był używany, jego rdzeń fuzyjny traci 1 ładunek. Jeśli wskutek tego liczba ładunków spadnie do 0, szkielet traci zasilanie. Komplikacje podczas testów <strong>Atletyki</strong>  wykonywanych w pancerzu wspomaganym mogą (decyzją MG) oznaczać zużycie dodatkowych ładunków, ponieważ przy zwiększonym wysiłku pancerz pobiera znacznie więcej energii.</li>\n<li><strong>Twarde lądowanie:</strong>Kiedy nosisz pancerz wspomagany, nie odnosisz żadnych obrażeń przy skoku lub upadku z dowolnej wysokości. Co więcej, gdy zeskakujesz z wysokości wyższej niż pierwsze piętro, przy lądowaniu zadajesz 3 DC obrażeń każdej istocie, która znajduje się w twoim zasięgu bezpośrednim – nawet przy braku zasilania pancerza.</li>\n<li><strong>Zwiększona Siła:</strong>Kiedy nosisz pancerz wspomagany, używasz jego Siły (wartość 11) zamiast swojej (na przykład w testach umiejętności lub przy obliczaniu Udźwigu albo wartości obrażeń zadawanych w walce wręcz). Dodatkowo ciężar samego szkieletu i zamontowanych na nim płyt pancerza nie wlicza się do noszonego przez ciebie ciężaru ekwipunku. Tracisz te korzyści, gdy pancerz wspomagany nie ma zasilania.</li>\n<li><strong>Zamknięte środowisko:</strong>Dopóki pancerz pozostaje hermetycznie zamknięty, czyli ma elementy pancerza w każdej lokalizacji i żaden z nich nie jest uszkodzony, posiada własną atmosferę, która umożliwia oddychanie pod wodą, w oparach trującego gazu lub w innych, równie groźnych warunkach. Tracisz te korzyści, gdy pancerz wspomagany nie ma zasilania.</li>\n<li><strong>Wytrzymałość ablacyjna:</strong>Kiedy zostaniesz zaatakowany lub z innego powodu odniesiesz obrażenia, są one zmniejszane o Odporność pancerza w danej lokalizacji, a ich ewentualny nadmiar narusza strukturę danego elementu (jego Punkty Zdrowia). Jeśli element pancerza otrzyma trafienie krytyczne (5 lub więcej obrażeń w jednym ataku) lub jego PZ spadną do 0, zostaje<strong>uszkodzony.</strong>.Taki element pancerza nie zapewnia już ochrony – ataki w tę lokalizację trafiają bezpośrednio w użytkownika i wtedy używa się jego Odporności oraz Punktów Zdrowia</li>\n<li><strong>Maszyna:</strong>Elementy pancerza nie odzyskują w naturalny sposób Punktów Zdrowia i nie można ich przywracać stimpakami lub za pomocą testów <strong>Medycyny</strong>. Trzeba je naprawić, tak samo jak w przypadku robotów (strona 34). Każdy Efekt, który wpływa na maszyny i roboty, oddziałuje tak samo na pancerz wspomagany.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
