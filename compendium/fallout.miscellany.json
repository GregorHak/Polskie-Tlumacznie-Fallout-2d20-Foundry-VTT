			"description": "<p>A Personal Information Processor manufactured by RobCo Industries. Under partnership with Vault-Tec, they were issued to many vault residents, though due to production constraints and ongoing development, different vaults received shipments of different versions of the Pip-Boy. The versions most encountered are variants of the Pip-Boy 2000 and Pip-Boy 3000, which are designed to be secured upon the wearer&rsquo;s wrist. Many models were designed with biometric locks, preventing them from being removed while the wearer still lives.</p>\n<p>A Pip-Boy is powered by an internal fission battery, providing a working lifespan for the device far greater than the expected life of its wearer (and, indeed, many Pip-Boys have been handed down within communities or families as heirlooms), and the device itself is sturdy enough to withstand basically anything.</p>\n<p>Not all Pip-Boys contain the same functions, but the common functions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A personal status indicator allows the wearer to see a report on their current health and wellbeing and any medical problems currently afflicting them.</li>\n<li>The device maintains an ongoing log of the wearer&rsquo;s activities, journey, and condition, and place for personal recordings to be made in either text or audio forms.</li>\n<li>An inbuilt holotape reader allows the device to accept compact holotapes, able to read and playback audio, video, data, and even games.</li>\n<li>It also functions as a compass, a radio, and a Geiger counter, and can generate light from its screen equivalent to a flashlight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, all Pip-Boy units aid their wearer during combat thanks to the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S. A character equipped with a Pip-Boy may use V.A.T.S. when they make an attack, ignoring the normal difficulty increase for targeting a specific location on the enemy.</p>"

			"description": "<p>A device which receives radio signals and translates them back into intelligible sounds. Used both before and after the War for entertainment purposes and emergency messaging alike, a radio is still only as good as the signal it receives. Most regions of the wastelands have a few radio stations active, playing old music for anyone with a working receiver, and a variety of groups make use of the remaining radio towers to broadcast signals to their members over long distances, but the range of these signals is still fairly limited.</p>"
