			"name": "Backpack, Large",
			"description": "<p>Available in a few different sizes, backpacks are invaluable for carrying larger quantities of items around. Most characters are assumed to be carrying items in pockets, belt pouches, and assorted bags and sacks, but a proper backpack helps carry items more easily and more efficiently. At least, if you don&rsquo;t have a pack brahmin or something else to carry your burdens.</p>"

		"Electronic Lockpicker": {
			"name": "Electronic Lockpicker",

			"name": "Holotags",
			"description": "<p>A small, durable, identifying item used by the Brotherhood of Steel. Holotags contain information to identify their wearer in case of death.

		},
		"Holotape Player": {
			"name": "Holotape Player",
			"description": "<p>A small device for playing back audio recorded to holotape, producing the sound out of a small speaker or into a connected set of headphones (not included).

		},
		"Lantern": {
			"name": "Lantern",
			"description": "<p>A simple oil or gas lamp, normally containing a flame fueled by an oil or gas reservoir. The flame is shielded by glass, and has a sturdy base allowing it to be placed down without risk of tipping over and breaking.

			"description": "<p>A rolled-up leather case containing an assortment of picks and tension wrenches for opening mechanical locks, as an alternative to the cruder &ldquo;screwdriver and bobby pins&rdquo; method.

		"Multi-Tool": {
			"name": "Multi-Tool",
			"description": "<p>A handy little device, containing a set of pliers, some wire cutters, a variety of small wrenches and screw drivers, and other small tools, all built into a single tool.

		"Pack Brahmin": {
			"name": "Pack Brahmin",
			"description": "<p>A large, two-headed mutant female cow used as a pack animal. The brahmin&rsquo;s profile is on p.341, and they can carry up to 500 lbs. of weight.</p>\n<p>The brahmin can also be milked once a day, requiring an AGI + Survival test with a difficulty of 1. Success means the brahmin produces one brahmin milk (p.161), plus one extra for each AP spent (maximum 5 brahmin milk). A brahmin also produces 2CD units of fertilizer (uncommon material) each day.</p>"

		"Pip-Boy": {
			"name": "Pip-Boy",
			"description": "<p>A Personal Information Processor manufactured by RobCo Industries. Under partnership with Vault-Tec, they were issued to many vault residents, though due to production constraints and ongoing development, different vaults received shipments of different versions of the Pip-Boy. The versions most encountered are variants of the Pip-Boy 2000 and Pip-Boy 3000, which are designed to be secured upon the wearer&rsquo;s wrist. Many models were designed with biometric locks, preventing them from being removed while the wearer still lives.</p>\n<p>A Pip-Boy is powered by an internal fission battery, providing a working lifespan for the device far greater than the expected life of its wearer (and, indeed, many Pip-Boys have been handed down within communities or families as heirlooms), and the device itself is sturdy enough to withstand basically anything.</p>\n<p>Not all Pip-Boys contain the same functions, but the common functions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A personal status indicator allows the wearer to see a report on their current health and wellbeing and any medical problems currently afflicting them.</li>\n<li>The device maintains an ongoing log of the wearer&rsquo;s activities, journey, and condition, and place for personal recordings to be made in either text or audio forms.</li>\n<li>An inbuilt holotape reader allows the device to accept compact holotapes, able to read and playback audio, video, data, and even games.</li>\n<li>It also functions as a compass, a radio, and a Geiger counter, and can generate light from its screen equivalent to a flashlight.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, all Pip-Boy units aid their wearer during combat thanks to the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System, or V.A.T.S. A character equipped with a Pip-Boy may use V.A.T.S. when they make an attack, ignoring the normal difficulty increase for targeting a specific location on the enemy.</p>"

		"Radio": {
			"name": "Radio",
			"description": "<p>A device which receives radio signals and translates them back into intelligible sounds. Used both before and after the War for entertainment purposes and emergency messaging alike, a radio is still only as good as the signal it receives. Most regions of the wastelands have a few radio stations active, playing old music for anyone with a working receiver, and a variety of groups make use of the remaining radio towers to broadcast signals to their members over long distances, but the range of these signals is still fairly limited.</p>"
		},
		"Signal Flare": {
			"name": "Signal Flare",
			"description": "<p>A small pyrotechnic device which burns brightly, generating a bright light for a short while. They&rsquo;re also extremely hot and can be used to ignite flammable substances and materials if placed close enough.</p>\n<p>These are larger and bulkier than the flares fired from a flare gun.</p>"
		},
		"Torch": {
			"name": "Torch",
			"description": "<p>A long branch or length of scrap metal, with a head wrapped in cloth soaked in a flammable liquid such as alcohol or gasoline. A decent enough improvised light source, and reusable to an extent.</p>"
